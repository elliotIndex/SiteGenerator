# Easy Site
The simplest website generator since 2017

## Making a site
To make a simple one-page site, go to [www.SiteGenerator.org](http://www.SiteGenerator.org)
and follow the directions there.

## Getting Started
To develop with this repository, clone the repo to your local machine and install the dependencies
with `npm install`.

To build a website, run `gulp build` and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Development
To run a development server with live reloading, run `gulp dev`. This will watch for changes in the
JS, HTML, and LESS files, rebuild the `dist` directory, and reload the page in your browser.

## Philosophy
Easy site is built to simplify website generation as much as possible. As such, changes should
favor simplicity over flexibility.
